# Chat-App
A Chat App made in Java is a program that allows two users to communicate with each other in real-time over a network. The app typically has a user interface where users can enter and send text messages, and receive messages from others in the same chat room. The Java programming language is often used to develop Chat Apps because of its robust networking capabilities, allowing for easy implementation of the communication protocols needed for real-time chat. Chat Apps can be built for a variety of use cases, such as personal or group communication, customer support, or team collaboration.
